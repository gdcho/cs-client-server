the remaining questions will relate to multithreading, use of threads to facilitate asynchronous operations, and thread safety in Java.Â  For preparation for these questions go through AssignmentIIaReferenceCode.zip attached to Assignment IIa folder, all Week 4 attachments, and ThreadSafety.java (Week 6 attachment).


No direct questions on Socket API (i.e. Socket and ServerSocket classes) will be asked as Network programming will be covered again in the second half of the course in C/C++ along with underlying protocol details.
